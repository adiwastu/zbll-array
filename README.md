# zbll-array
a better way to display 470+ algs on a desktop monitor compared to the usual scrolling experience of zbll sheets. The rows and colums are separated by BH pattern and COLL pattern. The clicking sounds are sampled from chess.com.

@TODO
add legacy algdb numbering to accomodate zbll users who are not familiar with BH recognition system.
