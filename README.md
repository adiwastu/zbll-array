# zbll-array
a better way to display 470+ algs on a desktop monitor compared to the usual scrolling experience of zbll sheets. The rows and colums are separated by BH pattern and COLL pattern. The pictures are manually drawn with Paint and generated by Discord AlgBot for the BH patterns and COLL patterns, respectively. The clicking sounds are sampled from chess.com.

@TODO

actually make the "Swap Sets" option working

add legacy algdb numbering to accomodate zbll users who are not familiar with BH recognition system.

add a way to feed txt file of 72 algs separated by new lines, ordered by algdb order (?) and automatically maps the thing

visual polishing for consistency: gen a few pics with UFR being white-green-red (credit: ore)
